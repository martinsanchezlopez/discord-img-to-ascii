# image-to-ascii
Yet another img to ascii converter... Except this one is bad... and comes with a discord bot 

Made with <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Pillow</a> and <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Discord.py</a>

I kinda works... Quite a bit of streching going as the orignal aspect ratio becomes too horizontal or vertical. Can't be bothered to fix it, I'd have to rewrite the whole thing basically.  

Don't try reading the code you'll get sick
